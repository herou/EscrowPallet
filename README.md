A fresh FRAME-based [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) node, ready for hacking :rocket:

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the Node Template, or get it up and running right from
your browser in just a few clicks using
the [Substrate Playground](https://docs.substrate.io/playground/) :hammer_and_wrench:

### Using Nix

Install [nix](https://nixos.org/) and optionally [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) and
[lorri](https://github.com/nix-community/lorri) for a fully plug and play experience for setting up
the development environment. To get all the correct dependencies activate direnv `direnv allow` and
lorri `lorri shell`.

### Rust Setup
